<p>Location and device orientation information can be used to
automatically orient the view.  The use of these is optional,
and answering &quot;no&quot; to the appropriate prompts disables this
and permissions will not be requested from the browser.  If enabled,
location and orientation data are used only to render the view visible
on the user's device and are not transmitted or logged.  If you have
privacy concerns, select &quot;no&quot; at both prompts to use 
mouse/touch interaction only at the default location.</p>

Continuing work on interaction.  Still seen some residual flakiness
during testing but that may be my fingers being too close together.

Zoom should really use the current pointer (center) location as the
invariant point for both wheely mouse and pinch gesture.  For the
latter the transitions seem to be a bit tricky.  We may need to fix
the coordinate system issues as below to make this work properly,
one way to do it would be to allow arbitrary roll rather than
forcing North up, then I think the problem is well-posed (would have
to add two-fingered rotation support).

Initial browser window orientation not read properly sometimes?

fix mouse moves to be in the correct projection

4096^2 is okay, but for better support on older devices 2048^2 would
be desirable.  can we do this without too much sacrifice?  we're
allowed 8 texture units.  26 sectors needs 6.5 2048^2 tiles with
optimal packing so each tile would have room for 4 sectors.

True North vs magnetic North, checks now we've done it.
